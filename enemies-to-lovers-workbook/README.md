# From Fury to Forever: The Enemies-to-Lovers Workbook

A structure-based workbook for romantasy writers who want to craft believable, emotionally earned enemies-to-lovers arcs—where hatred transforms into love through careful, incremental storytelling rather than instalove or plot shortcuts.

## What This Is

This is a **writing workbook**, not a craft book. It is designed to be opened beside your manuscript and filled in as you plan, draft, and revise your enemies-to-lovers arc. Every section includes worksheets, checklists, and write-spaces for active use.

## The Problem It Solves

The "Middle Gel"—the transition from genuine hatred to believable love—is the hardest part of the enemies-to-lovers trope. Most guides skip it entirely. This workbook focuses specifically on the incremental erosion of hostility, giving you scene-by-scene tools for every stage of the arc.

## Sections

| # | Section | What It Covers |
|---|---------|----------------|
| 1 | **The Foundation of Hatred** | Define structural conflict rooted in stakes, not personality quirks |
| 2 | **Character Wound & Misbelief** | Map the internal wounds that make love feel dangerous |
| 3 | **The Forced Proximity Matrix** | Plot the external catalyst that prevents avoidance |
| 4 | **The 12-Beat Tension Sheet** | Dual-arc integration mapping enemies arc against lovers arc |
| 5 | **The Middle Gel** | Scene prompts for incremental hostility erosion and non-sexual intimacy |
| 6 | **The Safety & Payoff Audit** | Final checklist ensuring the resolution is earned through growth |
| App | **Appendices** | Trope stacking guide, banter prompt deck, revision checklist |
