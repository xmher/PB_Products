## FOUNDATIONS

### What Makes a Well-Written Character?

Although broad questions like this are highly subjective, a good starting place would be:

- They're driven by a clear, strong 'want'.
- They go through a story arc.
- They have depth: flaws, fears, history.

> The character's "want" will drive the story. Being clear on this makes your story easier to write, as it guides your character's choices.

---

### What Is a Character Arc?

A character arc is the journey a character takes over the course of a story. It involves opposition, challenges, and changes to the character. It ultimately leads to resolution.

They can be:

1. **Transformational arc:** The main character changes throughout the story, usually from a regular person to a hero.
2. **Positive change arc:** The character changes for the better over the course of a story. (e.g. *A Christmas Carol*)
3. **Negative change arc:** The character changes for the worse over the course of a story. (e.g. *Breaking Bad*)
4. **Flat or static character arc:** Less common. A character stays the same, but the world changes.

You can choose which one you want, there's no right or wrong choice here. We'll dive deeper into this towards the end.

---

### Brainstorming a Character Arc

**What is your character like at the start of the novel?**

`___________________________________________________________`

**How do you want them to be at the end? Stronger, weaker, meaner, nicer, etc.?**

`___________________________________________________________`

**Brainstorm things that could happen to get them from A to B.** We will put more work into this at the end but it can be nice to go into the workbook with a rough idea.

`___________________________________________________________`

---

### What Drives Characters?

Every choice your character makes is influenced by something that has happened prior.

Just like a real person, your character has fears, goals, motivations, and needs.

For example, a character who grew up in a poor, dangerous environment might have the following:

- **Fear:** getting attacked, losing what little money they have
- **Goals:** become a knight
- **Motivation:** the desire for power and prosperity
- **Need:** safety and financial security

---

### What Is the Difference Between Motivation & Goal?

If you want to dye your hair, that's a goal you can write on your to-do list. But what motivates you? Something internal. The desire for change, or to look more beautiful.

In broad strokes:

- **Motivations ('wants')** are internal
- **Goals** are external & actionable

| Motivation | Goal |
|---|---|
| Keep their loved ones safe from the Evil Wizard | Go to the castle and kill the Evil Wizard |
| Feel popular and loved | Host the biggest party of the summer |
| Never want to go hungry ever again | Win £20,000,000 in a singing competition |

You need a goal to propel the story, and this goal is driven by an internal motivation.

---

### How to Find Your Character's Motivation

Their motivations may change throughout the book as they learn new things, but we're working on the start.

**What does your character think would make them happy?**
*(This is often different to what would actually make your character happy. E.g. fame, money, the love of a prince, power...)*

`___________________________________________________________`

**What has your character been told to want?**
*(Did they have a pushy parent or mentor? Are they burdened by duty? Did they receive societal messaging that told them what to want ("get married" etc)?)*

`___________________________________________________________`

**What does your character absolutely not want?**
*(What are they running away from, spending all their energy trying to avoid? What are they scared of? Is this justified?)*

`___________________________________________________________`

---

### How Do I Create Internal Conflict?

Often a character's motivation changes as the story goes on and they learn more things about the world and about themselves.

This is often because what a character wants at the start of the story doesn't align with what they need.

**For example:**

| | |
|---|---|
| **Goal** | To kill the evil Duke who murdered your mother. |
| **Motivation** | You want revenge. You witnessed the murder as a child, and grew up angry and traumatised. |
| **Need** | Closure, and emotional recovery. To acknowledge that this murder hurt you, in order to heal. |

What the character wants and needs are different, allowing them to learn and grow.

## BACKSTORY

### How to Write Backstory

Your character now has a motivation, but what made them this way?

Perhaps they crave riches because they were once poor. Perhaps they crave the love of a prince because they saw their mother lose everything by marrying a peasant.

Their backstory should explain their motive, but can also explain some of their traits.

If they are defensive and angry, perhaps someone hurt them in the past? If they are vain, perhaps they're used to people (such as their parents) only valuing them for their looks.

---

### How to Find Your Character's Backstory

**Summarise your character's main motivation:**

`___________________________________________________________`

**Write down some reasons why they may have acquired such a motivation. What events or lessons shaped their priorities to be this way?**

`___________________________________________________________`

---

### Backstory Relationships

If it is relevant to your story, consider how the relationships in a character's past have shaped who they are today.

For example, getting left at the altar might lead a character to be closed-off in love. Being neglected by their parents might make a character fear abandonment or become hyper-independent.

Although you may not choose to reveal the relationships from your character's past in your novel, you might benefit from knowing about them. This is because it may inform your characters' views and choices throughout the story.

---

### Writing Their Upbringing

A person's upbringing can shape who they grow up to become. For example:

| Upbringing | Traits Acquired |
|---|---|
| Competitive siblings | Ambition, determination, drive |
| Nurturing parents | Empathy, compassion, emotional intelligence |
| Strict parents | Discipline, responsibility, putting pressure on oneself |
| Lack of resources | Perseverance, resourcefulness, resilience, street smarts |
| Overprotective parents | Caution, risk-aversion, need for security OR rebellious |
| Absent parents | Independence, self-reliance, possible attachment issues |

These are just examples of how upbringing might shape someone, not rules to follow or universal truths. Think about what sort of experiences shaped your character.

---

### Upbringing & Backstory

**Describe (in as much detail as you'd like) your character's upbringing. Did they grow up rich, poor, smothered, neglected, pressured etc.?**

`___________________________________________________________`

**How did this impact their present-day personality?**

`___________________________________________________________`

---

### Family Relationships

**Describe your character's relationship with their family:**

`___________________________________________________________`

**How (if at all) did these relationships shape their present-day personality?**

`___________________________________________________________`

**What were the parents' criteria for approval?** *(E.g. achievements, gender, personality, etc.)*

`___________________________________________________________`

**Who was the favourite child in the family?**

`___________________________________________________________`

**Family's socioeconomic background:**

`___________________________________________________________`

**Key family values:**

`___________________________________________________________`

**What key lessons did the parents (or parent-figures) pass on?**

`___________________________________________________________`

**Did the family have any unique traditions or rules?**

`___________________________________________________________`

---

### Past Romantic Relationships

**How does your character feel about love?**

`___________________________________________________________`

**Which experiences shaped their view of love to be that way?**

`___________________________________________________________`

---

### How to Utilise Their Backstory

Now that you know their backstory and how this affects their motivation (which drives their goals), you should also consider how your character's past affects their...

- **Speech** (e.g. someone who once commanded an army might have a loud, booming voice)
- **Relationships** (How fast are they to open up to people? Are they hostile? Naive?)
- **Habits** (e.g. a surgeon might compulsively wash their hands, or someone who lived in a dangerous area might hold their belongings close and habitually check behind their shoulders while walking at night.)

---

## RELATIONSHIPS

### Writing Their Relationships

We learn a lot about a character from the way they interact with others. For example, if a character sucks up to their boss but treats their subordinates with contempt, readers will see them as fake, unlikeable, and perhaps a bit of a boot-licker.

Relationships can also be a great source of juicy conflict. It doesn't just have to be romantic. A friendship betrayal, a disappointed parent, or a back-stabbing colleague can provide plenty of drama.

Relationships a character may have had throughout their life could have turned them into the person they are today. A betrayal could have made them slow to trust. A talented older sibling might make them insecure or desperate to prove themselves.

---

### When Writing a Relationship...

- Convey nuances through dialogue and body language (e.g. a jealous glance, a forced smile, belly-laughter).
- Reflect on the ways in which one relationship contrasts or parallels another in the story.
- Consider the character's needs and desires within the context of the relationship. Are these needs being met?
- Plan how the relationship changes as the characters evolve & develop.
- Consider the ultimate resolution or trajectory of the relationship — whether it will evolve, deepen, or break apart.
- Know which "off-screen" relationships shaped your character (e.g. parents or an ex-lover who may not feature in the story).

> Remember that key relationships should serve a purpose in the overall narrative and contribute to character development.

### Platonic Relationships

**Describe your character's closest friend:**

`___________________________________________________________`

**What role do they play in each other's lives?**

`___________________________________________________________`

**Describe their dynamic:**

`___________________________________________________________`

*(If you have the Romance Workbook, perhaps have a flick through it at this point to get some ideas)*

---

### Writing Relationships

**Which person's loss would cause your character to fall apart? Why?**

`___________________________________________________________`

**Who is the most important person in their lives? Is this importance justified?**

`___________________________________________________________`

**Is there someone that they misjudge? How did this come to be?**

`___________________________________________________________`

---

### Writing Their Culture

Whether you're talking about a fantasy kingdom or your local suburb, every place has its own unique set of customs, norms, and traditions. Although your character might not be aware of it, they will be influenced in some way by their culture.

Your character most likely interacts with the world around them. They probably have some idea of what is expected of them in their culture.

Whether your character is a proud outsider or desperate to fit in, spend some time exploring their relationship with their culture and the people around them.

> *TIP: If you're also using the Worldbuilding Workbook, now might be an ideal time to have a peek at the Culture section.*

**Describe your character's culture(s):** *(Give information about norms, customs, expectations, & taboos, where relevant.)*

`___________________________________________________________`

**In which ways (if any) does your character conform to their culture? Do they enjoy doing this?**

`___________________________________________________________`

**In which ways (if any) does your character stray from their culture? Why do they do this?**

`___________________________________________________________`

---

## TRAITS

### Showing Their Traits

Pick a nice mix of good and bad traits, and think how you can demonstrate these traits. Think of actions your character might do that demonstrate these traits (e.g. clumsy characters might trip often, break things, spill food down their clothes, etc.)

Even if you don't end up using all these in your story, it can be helpful to have a bank of action beats you can pull from as you're writing.

> Remember, it's more convincing to show a trait than to just insist "she was really kind/clumsy/shallow" etc.

---

### Bank of Good Traits

Accessible, Active, Adaptable, Admirable, Adventurous, Agreeable, Alert, Amiable, Appreciative, Aspiring, Athletic, Attractive, Balanced, Benevolent, Brilliant, Calm, Capable, Caring, Charismatic, Charming, Cheerful, Clean, Clear-headed, Clever, Compassionate, Confident, Considerate, Cooperative, Courageous, Creative, Cultured, Curious, Daring, Debonair, Dedicated, Dignified, Direct, Disciplined, Discreet, Dutiful, Earnest, Educated, Efficient, Elegant, Eloquent, Empathetic, Energetic, Enthusiastic, Faithful, Farsighted, Firm, Flexible, Focused, Forgiving, Forthright, Freethinking, Friendly, Fun-loving, Gallant, Generous, Gentle, Genuine, Hardworking, Helpful, Heroic, Honest, Humble, Humorous, Idealistic, Imaginative, Incorruptible, Independent, Insightful, Intelligent, Intuitive, Inventive, Invulnerable, Kind, Logical, Lovable, Loyal, Mature, Modest, Neat, Objective, Observant, Open, Optimistic, Organised, Original, Passionate, Patient, Peaceful, Perceptive, Persuasive, Playful, Polished, Popular, Practical, Precise, Principled, Profound, Protective, Punctual, Purposeful, Rational, Realistic, Reflective, Relaxed, Reliable, Resourceful, Respectful, Responsible, Romantic, Scholarly, Scrupulous, Secure, Selfless, Self-reliant, Self-sufficient, Sensitive, Shrewd, Skilful, Sociable, Sophisticated, Spontaneous, Steadfast, Stoic, Strong, Studious, Suave, Subtle, Sweet, Sympathetic, Tasteful, Teacherly, Thorough, Tidy, Tolerant, Trusting, Upright, Urbane, Vivacious, Warm, Well-read, Wise, Witty

> Choose carefully, and try to balance these out with your negative traits — nobody is all good or all bad. Even your villain should have good traits and your heroes should have some flaws. This makes them more realistic and (more importantly) more interesting.
>
> The traits you display can depend on the people you're with. Some people are warm with their partner but otherwise very aloof.

### Writing Their Flaws

Flaws create internal and external conflicts within the character's journey and allow them to develop.

You can think about flaws in two key ways:

- **Weakness:** The conventional types of thing you may think of when you hear the word 'flaw' (e.g. greed, jealousy, rudeness)
- **Virtue gone too far:** For example, confidence is great but it can easily tip into arrogance. Other examples include assertiveness vs. aggression, honesty vs. brutal harshness, independence vs. self-isolating behaviour.

With the latter, characters may not even realise that these traits are flaws. This means part of their arc might be realising that something is wrong and needs to change.

| Flaw | How Does It Hold Them Back? |
|---|---|
| | |
| | |
| | |
| | |

**Are there any flaws they have that they don't see or refuse to acknowledge?**

`___________________________________________________________`

**How do their flaws affect their relationships with those around them?**

`___________________________________________________________`

**How do their flaws affect their ability to get what they want?**

`___________________________________________________________`

## APPEARANCE

### How to Describe Their Appearance

You can't judge a book by its cover, but based on appearance alone, certain traits can be communicated visually. For example, long flowing hair may indicate someone who spends time caring for it; a more complicated dress hints that someone might know or care about style; excessive detailing could mirror a frivolous personality.

---

### How to Decide Their Appearance

Certain physical traits can be used to communicate things about your character. Someone round-faced and wide-eyed would read as more innocent and naive than someone with beady eyes and thin lips.

Readers tend to make assumptions about characters based on their looks. You can use this as quick shorthand to describe side-characters efficiently, or you could subvert this by making readers think a character is one way and then revealing their true nature to be very different.

---

### Choosing Their Appearance — Visual Shorthand

*Remember, this is just guidance for visual shorthand. You can play to expectations or subvert them.*

| Trait | Visual Shorthand |
|---|---|
| **Cold** | Distant gaze, minimalistic and sleek clothing, an air of detachment. Monochromatic, sharp and structured silhouettes, a restrained and composed approach to hair and clothes, smile does not reach the eyes. |
| **Warm** | Earthy colours, cosy fabrics (e.g. wool cardigan), inviting smile, open and welcoming body language with big gestures, wide/sparkling eyes |
| **Bookish** | Intense and focused gaze, comfortable and practical clothing, unpretentious approach to fashion and hair, can be tidy or dishevelled, hunched posture |
| **Dreamy** | Flowing clothing, eccentric jewellery (like charms, whimsical earrings, etc.), whimsical patterns such as stars, moons, or floral motifs, ethereal fabrics (organza, silk), wistful gaze |
| **Fretful** | Chronically furrowed brow, disheveled clothing, fidgety and restless movements, messy and unkempt hair, dark circles under the eyes, gaunt |
| **Adventurous** | Practical clothing, sturdy footwear, tan or weather-beaten skin, possibly scars from adventures, rugged, sun-bleached or windblown hair, or hair worn in a practical style (e.g. buzzed, ponytail), calloused and strong hands. |
| **Seductive** | Slow movements, form-fitting or well-cut clothing, deep and rich colours, fabrics that drape or cling, intense gaze, may sit languidly |
| **Conniving** | Shrewd and calculating eyes, sleek clothing and hair, clean lines, neutral or dark colours, well-groomed, an air of poise, structured clothing |
| **Naive, sweet, childlike** | Round face, rosy cheeks, doe eyes, rosebud lips, short stature, impish, may wear pastels, ribbons, or florals |
| **Serious, grim** | Thin lips, wears dark/simple clothing, stiff-backed, pallid complexion |
| **Introverted, shy** | Hunched posture, plain clothes, dark hair, sunless skin, sheepish smile, hesitant or fumbling gestures, hairstyle partially covers face |
| **Artistic, ditzy, airheaded** | Long/thin fingers, poor posture, chaotic sense of dress, messy hair from absent-minded habits, trimmed nails, paint/ink-stained clothes |
| **Wealthy** | Tailored/expensive clothes, well-nourished, manicured nails, tan if travel is a display of wealth or pale in cultures where tans indicate field labour. |

---

### Appearance Based on Life Experience

| Previous Life Experience | Visual Shorthand |
|---|---|
| Courtesan, cares a lot about maintaining appearance | Perfectly filed nails, rouged lips/cheeks, nice clothes, immaculate hair |
| Farmer, lived a rough life filled with harsh outdoor labour | Calloused hands, a tan that ends above the elbows, muscled from working |

Discrepancy in appearance can show a bit about their history too. A knight can have some physical traits of a farmer to show a humble background. A pauper can wear threadbare but once-expensive clothes to show they were once rich, or perhaps a thief.

---

### Examples of Jobs Affecting Appearance (Modern)

| Job | Visual Shorthand |
|---|---|
| **Teacher** | At work they may wear comfortable and practical clothing that allows them to move freely. |
| **Surf Instructor** | May have a tan and/or freckles from working outdoors. May have saltwater curls or developed muscles from doing such a physical job. |
| **Soldier** | May wear patriotic symbols, good posture, may have cropped or practical hair and a strong body. |
| **Writer** | May have hunched posture due to typing, or spectacles due to screen use. May be pallid from time spent working indoors. |

### Examples of Jobs Affecting Appearance (Historical)

| Job | Visual Shorthand |
|---|---|
| **Royal / Nobleman** | Regal attire coloured with rare, expensive dyes (e.g. purple), ornate jewellery, dignified posture, graceful and deliberate movements, well-nourished, often pale from lack of working outdoors |
| **Peasant** | Worn clothing, made from coarse and practical fabrics with inexpensive dyes (earthy colours). Clothes may show signs of being mended many times. Calloused hands, tan & stooped posture from outdoor work. |
| **Warrior** | Armour or battle-worn clothing, confident posture, well-built and muscular physique, battle scars, calloused hands, alert gaze, powerful and purposeful movements |
| **Rogue / Thief** | Quick and agile movements, nimble physique, observant gaze, clothing that can conceal weapons/loot |

---

### How to Decide Their Appearance — Prompts

**What sort of job does your character do, and what does that involve? How does it impact their appearance?**
*(Think about the daily tasks your character does. E.g. An executioner may have strong arms from the axe, and a pale face from wearing his hood.)*

`___________________________________________________________`

**How might your character's personality be conveyed through their appearance?**

`___________________________________________________________`

**Will their appearance make the audience think something about this character that isn't true?**

`___________________________________________________________`

---

### Deciding Their Style

Using what we've learned about how appearance can be used as visual shorthand, we can distinguish our characters by giving them a sense of style.

Your character may not have much control over their physical features, but they can choose what they wear. This means clothing choices can be used to reveal character information to the audience.

Someone who prioritises function over style might wear comfortable shoes to a party. Someone who wants to blend in might consciously avoid ostentatious colour or cuts.

---

### Tips to Describe Clothes

- **Use Sensory Language** — If a scene calls for it, you can bring attention to a clothing choice by evoking the senses (e.g. the rustle of tulle skirts, the smell of old leather boots, the scratchiness/warmth of tweed, etc.)
- **Use Movement** — Call attention to a clothing choice via movement (e.g. the swish of skirts, or someone loosening a silk tie, or an impractically long coat's hem dragging in the mud)
- **Use Context** — A natural way to mention clothing is via context. Is someone overdressed for a party in their massive ballgown? Is it too hot for their favourite overalls and work boots?
- **Use Colour** — Symbolism can be a great way to convey character traits or plot information.

---

### How to Use Colour Symbolism

Of course a character isn't going to think, "Hm I'm going to wear a green dress today because I'm feeling envious." Colour symbolism is for your readers' benefit.

By using colour symbolism, you can provide subtle hints about a character's personality, emotions, or story arc.

> Remember that colour associations vary between cultures and countries. For example, in some countries white is the popular mourning colour, whereas many Western countries associate black with mourning instead.

| Colour | Symbolism | Character Traits |
|---|---|---|
| **Red** | Passion, power, energy, anger, lust | Assertive, passionate, aggressive |
| **Blue** | Calmness, trust, sadness | Introspective, serene, melancholy, intellectual |
| **Yellow** | Happiness, optimism | Cheerful, creative, bubbly, eccentric, warm |
| **Green** | Nature, growth, greed, envy | Earthy, nurturing, OR envious, conniving |
| **Black** | Mystery, elegance, death, grief | Authoritative, evil, sophisticated, brooding |
| **White** | Purity, innocence, clean/sterile | Pure, honest, naive, uncreative |
| **Purple** | Royalty, ambition | Regal, powerful, rich |
| **Pink** | Love, gentleness, femininity | Affectionate, youthful, kind, playful/silly |
| **Orange** | Enthusiasm, warmth | Energetic, extroverted, adventurous, fiery |

## VOICE

### How Should They Speak?

The way your character speaks can communicate a lot about them.

- **Do they use contractions?** Most people do, when speaking naturally. By avoiding them (can't → cannot) you can create a stiff, unnatural, formal air, such as that of a robot, or an ancient spirit.
- **Do they use slang?** A high-born lady might not even know what slang words mean, whereas a soldier or a dockworker might use rude words.
- **Are they eloquent?** Do they word themselves well and use a wide vocabulary? This could show that they are well-educated.
- **Are there words that they would never use? Why?**

The words your character uses can show their beliefs and histories:

- **Do they blaspheme?** If they curse the gods, they might not be very pious.
- **Do they use terminology specific to a field?** A soldier might still be stuck using militaristic terms after they leave the army. (Be reasonable with this though, don't have a doctor going "My diagnosis is that it's teatime.")
- **Are they prejudiced?** Do they use gendered insults, or use in-universe slurs such as Mudblood in Harry Potter? (Be careful with this one, and do some research).

---

### How to Describe Their Voice

You can use a character's voice to emphasise their traits, as certain types of voices are often associated with certain traits:

| Voice | Associated Traits |
|---|---|
| Booming | Boisterous, authoritative, powerful |
| Shrill | Annoying, high-strung, dramatic |
| Gravelly | Gritty, weathered, experienced |
| Monotone | Boring, unemotional, detached |
| Nasal | Nerdy, fussy, stuffy |
| Hushed | Secretive, mysterious, cautious |
| Squeaky | Childlike, fearful |
| Quiet | Reserved, introspective, shy, nervous |
| Deep | Commanding, authoritative |

| Delicate | Elegant, soft-spoken, vulnerable |
| Jittery | Nervous, restless, easily startled |
| Crisp | To-the-point, curt, blunt |
| Velvety | Charming, seductive, luxurious |

## HABITS & MANNERISMS

### Writing Habits & Mannerisms

The way your character carries themselves will depend based on their emotion and situations.

However, some people are more prone to calm, languid motions, and walk at a leisurely pace, and speak slowly. Others may make chaotic, unpredictable movements, and speak in a fast, excited way.

Even if a character is extremely patient and measured, they might be jumpy and nervous when afraid.

When we decide the mannerisms of a character, we're usually talking about them at their most neutral or comfortable state.

### Mannerisms & Habits — How to Use Them

Habits can be linked to specific personality traits. For example, a character with a habit of always being punctual may be seen as organised and reliable, perhaps even a bit fussy and high-maintenance. A frequent nail-biter may be read as nervous.

Habits can serve as emotional coping mechanisms. For instance, a character may have a habit of doodling or pacing when feeling stressed. You can use this habit to signal when this character is stressed without having to spell it out.

Habits can evolve, appear, or disappear over time, reflecting a character's (positive or negative) growth. As a character goes through transformative experiences, their habits may shift or new habits may form.

| Habit | Associated Traits/Circumstance |
|---|---|
| Pacing | Restlessness, anxiety, planning |
| Nail-biting | Nervousness, stress, insecurity |
| Organising items | Orderliness, need for control |
| Checking Phone | Boredom, distraction, loneliness |
| Biting Lips | Nervousness, anxiety, deep thought |
| Collecting | Sentimentality, nostalgia |
| Repeating Phrases | Comfort, anxiety reduction, self-soothing |
| Fidgeting | Restlessness, agitation, boredom |
| Cracking Knuckles | Nervousness, tension release |
| Checking Mirror | Self-consciousness, grooming |

## NAMES

### How to Choose Names

Before you name your characters, consider the setting.

Your characters' names need to reflect the setting. If your book is set in a fantasy world based heavily on 5th century China, you might not want to call your main character Brittany Flowerbomb.

If you're inventing names from scratch, use sounds that mirror the language the characters speak in-universe, if you have one.

Also consider readers' expectations of the time period. For example, Tiffany might be an accurate medieval name but your readers could find it jarring.

---

### Distinguishable Names

If you have more than one character, consider giving them names that start with different letters.

Your names need to be distinguishable by people who like to read quickly. It's not a rule, but it can make reading your book a bit smoother.

For example, if you have three characters called Joan, Juan, and John in a scene together, it can get very confusing.

---

### Associations with Names

Name associations can help reinforce a character's traits.

Readers might associate a name like Griffin with the characteristics of a griffin (strength, might, etc.) whereas a name like Fey might be associated with their namesake, fairies (daintiness, etc.).

You can use these associations to give readers certain expectations about characters. These expectations may be subverted later, if you wish.

A name like Luna (meaning moon) might be mysterious or magical. Naming a character Minerva draws an association with the Ancient Roman goddess of war strategy and wisdom.

You can draw associations to: Literary characters, Elements, Mythological figures, Bodies of nature, Colours, Mythological beasts, Virtues, Animals, Historical figures, Weather

---

### Using Names for Effect

Names can be used to emphasise traits of a character (by matching them — i.e. a gruff warrior called Boarheart) or they can contrast the character for comedic effect (like giving that same name to a Princess).

This comedic technique works better for side-characters, or in more lighthearted stories.

> Name generators may be best avoided by those looking to name their characters with intention. Instead, have a look at censuses, baby name websites, or these resources:

---

### Choosing Nicknames

Depending on how well people know your character, they might call them a different name. Colleagues might use their surname, for example, or they might use a nickname.

In real life, people may have 10s of nicknames. However, for the sake of your readers you might want to maintain some consistency and use nicknames sparingly.

**What nicknames (if any) does your character have, and who calls them by this nickname?**

`___________________________________________________________`

**How does your character feel about their nickname?**

`___________________________________________________________`

---

## OCCUPATION

### Choosing Their Occupation

Your character's line of work will give them skills, opportunities, and perspectives that make them unique.

Jobs can also affect how you look (e.g. a lumberjack might have calloused hands or a dentist might have poor posture), how you act (e.g. surgeons might compulsively wash their hands or keep their nails short), and the sort of information you would know.

## CHARACTER ARC

### Character Development

Your protagonist starts off wanting something (their goal). Then they face external and internal challenges that stand in the way of their goal. These conflicts should be significant and force the character to confront their flaws and limitations.

This change should be gradual. The growth should feel authentic and consistent with their established personality and experiences.

Conclude the character arc by showing how your character has changed and how they have achieved (or adjusted) their initial goal. Ensure that their growth feels earned and satisfying to the reader.

> When you are filling in this section, you may benefit from referring back to the first chapter from time to time.

### Tips to Write a Character Arc

- Whether the character achieves their original goal or finds a new purpose, the resolution should feel earned. This means they need to work (and maybe suffer a bit) to get their happy ending, if they get one.
- Show incremental changes so the transformation doesn't feel too jarring and convenient.
- You don't need to conclude the arc with a character turning into a perfect person.
- Let them make decisions and take risks throughout the story. Then when they mess up it'll be their own fault, pushing them to change and develop.
- Put them in situations that force them to confront their weaknesses and try to overcome them, or situations that force them to confront a fundamental mistruth that they harbour.
- Supporting characters can provide guidance, challenge the protagonist, and serve as mirrors on this journey.
