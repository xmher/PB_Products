## Dear Writer,

Congratulations on deciding to write a story! Whether it's your first story or your 100th, and whether you started years ago or this morning, your words are valuable.

Writing isn't always easy, but by committing to this project, you've already done better than anyone who's just dreaming about it.

Finally, I want to thank you from the bottom of my heart for supporting this small business (actually, a super small business ...it's just 1 person!)

Wishing you all the best!

## Before You Start

This workbook is split up into 3 acts. However, if your story doesn't follow a 3-act structure, don't worry! This is just there to make the workbook easier to follow.

Everything discussed is still applicable if you choose to write your book (or subplot) with a different structure.

Don't forget: If you want to delete any pages that you find unhelpful, you can and should! This workbook is about helping you to write your love stories. Adapt it to suit your unique needs.

Best of luck on your writing adventure! Happy writing!

# Plot Structure

## Typical 3 Act Structure in Romance

**Act 1:** Lay the groundwork. Introduce the characters and setting. Show their goals, fears, flaws, etc. End with the inciting incident.

**Act 2:** Build tension & momentum. They get to know each other. The love is deepening. But so is the conflict! Ends with the darkest moment.

**Act 3:** Resolution of whatever the darkest moment was. Winning the person back. They come together stronger, having learned lessons.

---

## More Detail on Structure

### Act 1

- **Inciting Incident:** Characters meet for the first time, or are thrown together in strange new circumstances.

### Act 2

- **Rising Action:** As the story's events unfold, your characters' relationship deepens and develops.
- **Crisis:** Something threatens the romance. Perhaps they even decide not to be together, or have a fight, or break up.

### Act 3

- **Climax:** Problem solved / big romantic gesture. They finally get together! (or not)
- **Denouement:** Happily ever after (or not)

Feel free to deviate from this. It's just a guide. The following pages will contain a template of this structure. Feel free to save it until the end or use it to brainstorm.

## Writing a Romantic Subplot

Your subplot should support your overall story.

Your subplot can complement your main story and follow this structure loosely, although it doesn't have to.

Subplots can be used in counterpoint to the main plot, with events rising in the subplot when they fall in the main plot, and vice versa. They usually converge together at the climax.

Of course, you don't have to follow this structure. You can deviate as much as you want.

# Setting the Foundations of Your Story

## Designing Your Characters

We won't re-hash what you've already learned in the character workbook. However, you should make sure your characters have motivations, fears, goals, and desires that have nothing to do with the romantic subplot.

You want them to feel fleshed out. They should think about other things than just love. The more well-rounded your characters are, the more real they will feel, and the more your readers will enjoy reading about them.

They should also have flaws and limiting beliefs that might make a romantic relationship difficult. For example, perhaps they're scared of letting people get close to them. Perhaps they're smothering and meddlesome. Perhaps they're inflexible and unwilling to compromise.

When designing your two characters, try and see how their flaws and merits will challenge each another. See where they're similar vs different.

---

## Who Are Your Main Couple?

The main characters of romance novels tend to have two aspects to them...

### Contrast

When you create a couple that are opposites in many ways, it can lead to a dynamic filled with tension, excitement, and personal growth.

Contrasting characters have the potential to learn from each other. They may help each other step out of their comfort zone or view the world from a different perspective. The differences between the characters can lead to conflict, but this conflict can also generate intense chemistry.

### Harmony

Even if they seem like polar opposites, your couple will have some points of likemindedness that allow them to bond, even if it takes a while to discover these similarities.

Even characters who are opposites will have some similarities, and very likeminded characters will still have differences and points of conflict.

---

## Popular Main Couple Dynamics

When designing your main couple, think about how they'll play off each other. Popular dynamics include:

| Dynamic | Explanation |
|---------|-------------|
| **Sunshine + Grumpy** | One character is cheerful, optimistic, and full of energy (the "sunshine"), while the other is more reserved, serious, or grumpy. |
| **Wild Child + Responsible** | One character is adventurous, impulsive, and often takes risks while the other is responsible and cautious. |
| **Nurturer + Protector** | One character is nurturing, compassionate, and caring, often taking care of others while the other is protective, willing to defend and support their loved ones. |
| **Pragmatist + Dreamer** | One character is practical and focused on achieving tangible goals, while the other is a dreamer who revels in imagination and creativity. |
| **Energetic + Calm** | One character is full of energy and enthusiasm, while the other is calm and collected, often providing a sense of balance. |

## Writing Your Couple's Names

When naming your leading couple, remember that their names should be distinct. Avoid naming them things like John & Joan, Michael & Michelle, Ana & Hannah, etc. Of course, your story your rules, but keeping the names of your leads distinct will help your story to read better, avoiding confusion.

Besides this, when naming your characters, try and consider:

- **Time Period:** You can use a census to verify name popularity if your story is set in the past.
- **Culture:** Resources like BehindtheName can help you find names that match your characters' cultures.
- **Personality:** More reserved personalities can be reflected by classic or traditional names. Characters who are more free-spirited or unique might have unconventional names.
- **Association:** Names can evoke various expectations due to associations. For example, readers might expect a character named Juliet to be romantic.

## Defining Your Characters' Views

Your characters' views will influence how they make romantic choices, and how their relationship evolves. Their views may also give some opportunities for bonding/conflict. Establish/hint relevant views early on.

# Setting

## Selecting Your Setting

Setting helps establish the emotional tone of the story. It can convey warmth, excitement, nostalgia, or any other desired emotional atmosphere, which in turn, influences the reader's emotional response to the characters and their relationships.

A well-described setting immerses readers in the story, making them feel like they are right there with the characters. This level of engagement can heighten emotional involvement and investment in the romance as well as being more immersive and enjoyable.

Settings often carry symbolic meaning in romance novels. For instance, a palace may represent fairy-tale romance, while a cabin in the woods can reinforce themes of intimacy and self-discovery. The setting can emphasise the themes and messages the author wants to convey.

Let's develop your story's setting.

---

## Writing Your Setting

**Where does the story take place? Which place and which time period?**

___

**How does the setting impact the mood or atmosphere of the story (e.g. is it cosy, dark, etc.)?**

___

**Does the setting have any cultural or societal norms that impact the romance?**

___

**Are there any specific local traditions related to courtship or dating?**

___

**Are there any social taboos or restrictions in the setting that impact the characters' daily lives?**

___

**How does the setting affect the characters' values and beliefs, if at all?**

___

### Key Locations

*Keep track of any spots in your wider setting where your characters might go (e.g. flats, coffee shops, etc.)*

# Side Characters

Side characters are often an important part of romantic novels. They can introduce conflict or obstacles to the budding romance. This can be in the form of a disapproving friend, a meddling family member, or a rival for one of the main characters' affections.

Side characters may have their subplots that intersect with the main plot. These subplots can provide opportunities for character growth, add layers to the story, and ultimately influence the development of the main romance.

Well-developed side characters can be endearing to readers. They create a sense of familiarity and connection, making readers invested in their stories and relationships, not just those of the main characters. It might create a cosy vibe or add a layer of realness or comedy.

Comedic side characters can lighten the mood and provide a break from the emotional intensity of the romance.

---

## Common Types of Side Characters

| Type | Explanation |
|------|-------------|
| **Foil** | Contrasts with the protagonist, highlighting their strengths / weaknesses. Offers a different perspective on love / relationships, challenging the protagonist's beliefs. More often the two love interests are each other's foils, but sometimes it can be someone else. |
| **Mentor** | Guides the main character in matters of love. Acts as a source of support & guidance. |
| **Matchmaker** | Characters who actively or unintentionally play a role in bringing the main characters together, a catalyst for the romance. |
| **Comic Relief** | Provides humour and levity to balance emotional intensity. Delivers witty one-liners, engages in amusing situations, or exhibits eccentric behaviour. |
| **Confidants** | Characters with whom the main characters share their deepest feelings, often serving as a means for emotional catharsis. They may encourage the characters to take a risk in the name of love. |

## Romance Antagonists

Antagonists in romance novels are characters who serve as an obstacle or source of conflict in a romantic relationship.

Unlike the traditional antagonist in a story who may be a villain or adversary, a romance story's antagonist doesn't often have malicious intent but plays a role in creating tension or challenges within the romantic plot.

Antagonists are not necessarily villains; they are often complex characters with their own motivations and emotions. Their role in the story is to challenge the main characters' relationship and provide opportunities for character development, growth, and exploration of the themes of love and commitment.

Not all romantic stories have antagonists. Sometimes the conflict stems from external circumstances (e.g. distance) or internal obstacles (e.g. commitment phobia).

---

## Common Types of Romance Antagonists

| Type | Explanation |
|------|-------------|
| **Love Rival** | A character who competes for the affections of one of the main characters, often forming a love triangle. They are often depicted as a viable alternative to the primary love interest. |
| **Familial Opposition** | Family members can oppose the romantic relationship for various reasons. This can stem from differences in social class, cultural background, or personal prejudices. |
| **Ex-Partner** | They may still have unresolved feelings, creating tension and jealousy. This can lead them to try and break the couple up or win back their original partner. |
| **Best Friend** | A close friend of one of the main characters. They might offer well-intentioned or malicious advice about the romantic relationship, leading to conflict. |
| **Rival** | One of the characters may have a rival (e.g. in the workplace) who wants to break them up out of spite. |

# Tropes

## What's the Deal with Tropes?

Tropes in romantic novels are recurring themes, plot devices, character types, or narrative elements that are commonly used in fiction. Popular examples include enemies to lovers and second chance romance.

Tropes often provide a sense of familiarity to readers. People may seek out specific tropes because they enjoy the comfort of knowing what to expect. This can help with marketing your novel, as readers may favour certain tropes. For example, some romance readers actively seek out (or actively avoid) novels with certain tropes.

However, overuse or poor execution of tropes can lead to cliché or formulaic storytelling, which can turn readers away. When tropes are used without creativity or depth, they can make a story feel predictable or uninspired.

You can choose to lean into tropes, subvert them, or avoid them altogether.

---

## How to Write Tropes

Before you can use a trope effectively, it's essential to understand it thoroughly. Study examples of the trope in other works to see how it has been used, what makes it work, and how it can be subverted or modified.

Tropes can serve as a solid foundation for your story, providing a familiar structure that readers can connect with. However, don't stop there. Your characters are the heart of your story. Invest time in developing well-rounded, believable characters, regardless of tropes.

One effective way to use tropes is to subvert reader expectations. Introduce twists or variations that challenge the typical outcomes associated with the trope. If you go down this route, identify the most predictable aspects of the trope and consider how you can challenge them. For example, you might subvert a love triangle trope by ending it in the two potential love interests rejecting the main character.

---

## Popular Romance Tropes

| Name | Examples |
|------|----------|
| **Grumpy / Sunshine** | One character is grumpy, cynical, or reserved, while the other is cheerful, optimistic, or outgoing. Their contrasting personalities lead to romantic tension and eventual connection. |
| **Enemies to Lovers** | Two characters start as adversaries or enemies and gradually develop romantic feelings for each other over the course of the story. This trope uses the tension of the rivalry to create romantic tension and an aspect of forbidden desire. |
| **Fake Dating** | Characters pretend to be in a romantic relationship, often for various reasons such as to make someone jealous or gain an advantage. This pretence usually leads to genuine romantic feelings. |
| **He Falls First** | The male main character falls in love before the other (usually female) main character. They may or may not confess. Readers often see the male main character's PoV with this trope. |
| **Marriage of Convenience** | Characters enter into a marriage for practical reasons, such as a business arrangement or to fulfil a political obligation. Over time, they may discover true love in their unconventional union. |
| **Bodyguard Romance** | One character is a bodyguard responsible for protecting their love interest. As they spend time together, romantic feelings develop amid danger and intrigue. |
| **Only One Bed** | Characters find themselves in a situation where they must share a single bed, often due to limited accommodations. This close proximity can lead to intimacy. |
| **Second Chance Romance** | Characters who were once in a romantic relationship but broke up due to various reasons get a second chance at love. |
| **Forced Proximity** | The central characters may not get along, but they are forced to spend a significant amount of time in close quarters due to situations beyond their control (e.g. delayed flight), and they grow close. |

# Naming the Novel

You might want to come back to this at the end, but here are a few strategies you can use to develop your romance novel's name:

| Strategy | Explanation |
|----------|-------------|
| **Motif** | Titles can draw from motifs or symbolism in your story. For example, "Hearts in Bloom" for a story with a floral theme. |
| **Contrasts** | Titles that juxtapose opposites or contrasts can be good for stories where opposites attract. E.g. "Fire and Ice" |
| **Question** | Pose a question or hint at a mystery in your title to pique readers' curiosity. E.g. "What Happened to Emma Rose?" |
| **Setting** | If the setting plays a significant role in your story, you can incorporate it into the title. E.g. "A Coffee Shop in Paris" |
| **Numbers** | E.g. "7 Ways to Lose Your Soulmate" |
| **Alliteration** | Many novels play with alliteration in their titles. E.g. "Lover's Lane", "Royal Rebel" |

**What kind of mood or vibe are you trying to convey with your novel's name? (e.g. funny, tragic, etc.)**

___

**What are some key themes, characters, locations, or ideas that you might want to use for your title?**

**Use this space to brainstorm titles for your project:**

# Act I — The Setup

## Writing the Opening

Your main characters typically start a romance novel wanting something. Something about their life is not fulfilling them. This could be a job, a relationship, a boring town, etc.

We often get to see one or both of the characters grappling with their day to day lives at the start of the story. This gives us a chance to get to know the characters and their surroundings, as well as introducing side characters.

You may be tempted to rush to the meet-cute (valid — you absolutely can do that!) but this part of the story gives us an opportunity to show readers just how much the romance changes each character's life by contrasting it with their regular old life.

In this part of the story, show readers enough details to make characters relatable and intriguing, but leave room for growth and development throughout the story.

**What does Character 1's regular life look like? What are they struggling with, whom do they speak to, etc.?**

___

**What does Character 2's regular life look like? What are they struggling with, whom do they speak to, etc.?**

___

## The Moment Your Characters First Meet

The way your characters meet can set the tone for their relationship, and for the story. Not only that, but readers love unique first meetings.

When you design their first meeting, think about: whether it makes sense for your characters to be in the situation they're in. Does it make sense with their personality? What led to them being in that situation.

**Brainstorm this here:**

___

---

## Ideas for Your First Meeting

### Contemporary

Strangers share a taxi, Fighting for rare book, Got on wrong flight, Job interview, Trapped in snowstorm, Set up by their mums, Sports tournament, Laundromat, Emergency room, New bodyguard, Trespasser, Mixed-up drink order, Got into wrong Uber, Coffee shop, Florist, Mistaken for an ex, Paint store, Accidental break-in, Share a jail cell, Actor & stunt double, Con artist & victim, Strangers on train, Robbing the same house, Drunk on holiday, Bumpy plane ride, 2 sides of a protest, Actors on movie, Spilled drink, Medical emergency, Dancing class, Tattoo shop, Costume party, Archeological dig, Red carpet event, New flatmates

## Writing the Initial Conflict

You've set up your world, your characters have met, now it's time to force them to spend some time together. Think about which event sets the story in motion. For example, two royals may meet and take an immediate dislike to each other, but the conflict that propels the plot is the moment they're told that they will need to wed to secure a political alliance.

This key event often forces the characters to make a choice — one that will drive the plot.

For example, when a plane crash forces two characters to spend time together. This forces them to decide whether to team up and improve their chances of survival, or go their own ways.

Another example is that two characters are invited to the same wedding, single. They can either go as each other's fake dates or go alone and risk being criticised by their judgemental families.

**What is the initial conflict or obstacle?**

___

**What question or decision does it force the protagonists to make?**

___

**What do they think will come of this, and how do they feel about it?**

___

---

## How Does Act I End?

Act 1 usually ends with the characters accepting the call to adventure.

For example: Protagonists agree to be each other's fake dates for their mutual enemy's wedding. Rival protagonists decide to team up during a competition to take down the frontrunner. Two characters both agree to go on an arctic expedition together.

You don't need to announce the end of act 1 with trumpets and balloons. Just be aware, as a writer, that from this point on, you're going to be spending some time communicating the characters' growing closeness and attraction. Act 2 is also when the conflict starts to increase.

---

## Overview of Act 1

|  | Character 1 | Character 2 |
|--|-------------|-------------|
| **How they start the story** | | |
| **What they want** | | |
| **What they need** | | |
| **Thoughts upon meeting** | | |
| **Accepting the call to adventure** | | |

---

# Act II — Confrontation

## Starting Act II

The first half of act 2 is a crucial phase in a romance story, as it's where the characters' connection evolves and deepens despite the obstacles they face. This phase is essential for readers to become emotionally invested in the characters' love story.

This phase often begins with the characters spending more time together voluntarily or due to circumstances. We see the first seeds of attraction grow into something more solid, even for couples who are still bickering at this point.

They may start slowly opening up to each other and noticing more things they like about each other as this part of the story progresses.

Often characters are reluctant to give way to their emotions at this point, which is what allows writers to maintain a level of tension. However, the growing attraction reaches a point where it becomes undeniable.

---

## As the Relationship Develops

|  | Character 1 | Character 2 |
|--|-------------|-------------|

## How to Write Attraction

Act 2 shows the characters getting to know each other better. Their attraction will be building, whether or not they want to fight it.

There is often a special sort of tension here: The characters want each other, but they may not want to state this desire aloud.

Romance readers tend to love this tension. As a writer, you can play into it, balancing the character's desire with their inability (or unwillingness) to speak it aloud.

Usually in act 2, intimacy also grows. Emotional intimacy should grow during act 2. It's up to you whether or not you want to increase the physical intimacy too. There are plenty of tame ways to do this.

---

## Writing Romantic Tension

The tension between your characters is the palpable anticipation of a romantic or physical encounter. It's the feeling that something intense and intimate is about to happen, but it's not quite there yet.

This tension creates a strong engagement for readers. The allure of what might happen is exciting for readers, and it keeps them hooked.

This tension doesn't necessarily need to lead to explicit content. It's about the build-up, the chemistry, and the emotional connection between characters. Where you go from there is up to you!

Tension is often rooted in anticipation. Readers should eagerly anticipate the moment when the characters confess their feelings, share their first kiss, or overcome the central obstacles to their love. This anticipation keeps readers turning the pages to see the resolution of the romantic arc.

### How to Write Romantic Tension

- **Body language:** Show how characters react to each other physically — e.g. leaning in, holding prolonged eye contact, or how their heart rate quickens when they're near each other.
- **Inner monologue:** You can show characters' internal struggles, longing, and fantasies.
- **Build-up:** Describe the characters' increasing physical closeness and the electric anticipation that precedes a moment of intimacy when/if it finally comes.
- Building anticipation is crucial for tension. You don't need to rush to resolve the tension or fulfil the characters' desires. You can allow it to simmer and linger throughout the story, leaving readers eagerly awaiting the eventual payoff.
- To heighten the tension, you can create moments when the characters come close to giving in to their desires but then pull back, heightening the anticipation.

## Body Language of Attraction

| Aspect | Explanation / Examples |
|--------|----------------------|
| **Touch** | Light, incidental touches (e.g., brushing fingers, accidental contact), purposeful touches (e.g., hand-holding, placing a hand on the arm while laughing), holding on longer during a hug |
| **Smiling & Laughing** | Laughter or playful smiles during conversation, playful teasing and banter, shared in-jokes |
| **Self-Grooming** | Tucking hair behind the ear or playing with strands while talking, fixing clothing or jewellery, adjusting posture |
| **Mirroring** | Subconsciously copying each other's gestures and postures, picking up each other's speech patterns by accident |
| **Eyes** | Frequently glancing at the other person's lips during conversation, holding eye contact while speaking, even during vulnerable moments |

---

## Creating Chemistry Through Dialogue

Here are ways you can use dialogue to show romantic chemistry:

| Technique | Explanation |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Banter** | Teasing, humour, and light banter in which there's a witty push and pull. |
| **Play With Silence** | Sometimes, what characters don't say can be as powerful as what they do say. Use silence, pauses, and lingering glances to convey unspoken emotions. |
| **Dialogue Tags** | Dialogue tags (like "said" and "whispered") can be used to convey a sense of chemistry, or a double meaning to the character's words ("they stammered", etc.) |
| **Parallel Thoughts** | Show how characters can continue each other's thoughts or ideas. This implies a strong connection and understanding. |
| **Vulnerable Chats** | Vulnerable conversations should come after some intimacy is built. When they confide in one another, it deepens their emotional connection. |
| **Callbacks** | Characters show they paid attention to an offhand comment the other made earlier, remembering a small detail, showing they care. |

---

## Ideas to Show the Growing Emotional Intimacy

- Opening up about their pasts
- Discussing their fears
- Thoughtful gestures
- Facing and resolving conflicts together
- Teaching each other about their customs
- Remembering things about the other (e.g. how they take their tea/coffee) without asking
- Physiological ease/relaxation when together
- Whispering late at night, sharing stories
- Taking the other to emotionally significant places (e.g. the house where they grew up)
- Private jokes
- Turning to the other one in times of crisis
- Feeling safe to share their most vulnerable thoughts and secrets

Remember, these moments need to be earned. They come after some time spent getting to know and trust one another.

---

## Ideas to Show the Growing Physical Intimacy

- Braiding someone's hair
- Taking someone's hands to console them
- Fixing someone's wounds
- Raising someone's knuckles to your lips in greeting (e.g. before a dance)
- Borrowing clothes and noticing the smell
- Falling asleep with their head on your shoulder/lap
- Big warm greeting hug that lasts too long
- Wiping away their tears
- Fixing someone's clothes / tie / hair
- Sharing a blanket and being over-aware of your physical proximity
- Doing someone's makeup and noticing their eye colour

## How to Write Conflict

Act 2 is often when conflict starts to grow.

Your characters have spent some time getting closer. However, their differences (or some external factors) challenge them, and force them to make difficult decisions. This pressure causes your characters to change and grow — i.e. to be dynamic, not static.

If your characters want love, they need to first work on a flaw. This flaw has always been there from the start, but this new relationship shines a spotlight upon it. The characters either need to change, or to accept that they'll lose out on the love of their life.

This flaw can be anything — workaholism, commitment issues, passivity to their overbearing family, etc.

Overcoming the obstacle will force character development. It's make or break!

## How to Write Internal Conflict

Stories are more engaging when there are internal conflicts complementing the external ones.

Readers enjoy it when the love interests like each other for reasons beyond just "they're so hot". The characters should be able to learn from each other. They should be able to challenge each other's limiting beliefs and grow together.

Alternatively, if you're writing a toxic romance, you can show what draws them together but also where their unsolvable conflicts arise from.

Writer Sophie Penbroke uses an "emotional conflict square" to achieve this. This workbook presents a slightly adapted version of Penbroke's square.

---

## Conflict Square (Example)

|  | Weakness | Strengths | Lesson |
|--|----------|-----------|--------|
| **Character 1** | Limiting trait/beliefs. E.g. They can't trust people. | What can they teach the other? Carefulness? Resilience? Etc. | What do they need to learn? E.g. To open up and let people in. |
| **Character 2** | Limiting trait/belief. E.g. They're too much of a pushover. | What can they teach the other? Optimism? Openness? Etc. | What do they need to learn? E.g. To stand up for themselves. |
| **Relationship** | Do these flaws create conflict? How? | Do these traits bring them closer together? How? | Do they learn from each other? What, and how? |

## Your Characters' Conflict Square

|  | Weakness | Strengths | Lesson |

| **Character 1** | | | |
| **Character 2** | | | |
| **Relationship** | | | |

## How to Write the All Time Low

Act 2 usually ends with an all time low. The obstacle almost breaks the couple up in many romantic stories.

You don't need to have an act 2 breakup, but this is usually the point in a 3 act structure where things get dire.

The challenge is huge, and it requires the couple to make a huge change in their mindset/actions/life if they ever want to salvage the relationship. This conflict should be significant enough to challenge the relationship but not insurmountable.

A lot of romance stories choose to hinge the story's all time low around a misunderstanding or miscommunication, but it can often be stronger to base the all time low around a flaw or choice that characters are making.

**Clearly define the central issue that leads to the all-time low.**

___

**How does each character feel about this?**

___

**How does each character deal with this? (e.g. booking a flight, reaching out to their ex, etc.)**

___

# Act III — The Payoff

## After the Climax, They Recover

Usually, after the "all time low" of the relationship, some effort is put in to recovering the relationship.

Usually, characters need to sacrifice something in order to be together (e.g. a relationship with a family member / their claim to the throne / their white collar job).

Usually this sacrifice is a culmination of the lessons they learned. For example:

| Stage | Example |
|-------|---------|
| **Lesson that needed to be learned** | Character 1 needed to learn how to grow a spine and stand up to their overbearing mum. |
| **Conflict** | Character 1's mum keeps meddling and doing things that hurt Character 2. Character 2 is sick of not being defended and breaks things off. |
| **Recovery** | Character 1 finally confronts their mother, asserts their independence, and goes to win their love back. |

---

## Surpassing the Romantic Obstacles

Conflict allows characters to grow and improve. Here are some ways that obstacles can be used to provide character growth in stories:

| Obstacle | Character Growth (Example) |
|----------|---------------------------|
| **Workaholism** | Prioritise personal relationships by recognising the importance of work-life balance. Establish clear boundaries between work and personal life, respecting partner's needs. Allocate quality time for loved ones. |
| **Stubbornness** | Growing to learn the importance of compromise in relationships. Develop active listening skills to understand the partner's perspective and needs. Learn to meet in the middle. |
| **Perfectionism** | Realise that love accepts imperfections and that no one is perfect. Share feelings of inadequacy with the partner, allowing them to offer support and reassurance. |
| **Fear of Abandonment** | Communicate openly with the partner about the fear and its origins, seeking reassurance and support. Develop trust in the partner's commitment. |
| **Commitment Phobia** | Explore the root causes through introspection. Gradually open up and allow oneself to become vulnerable in the relationship. Maintain open and honest communication with the partner about fears and concerns. Allow positive relationship experiences to gradually ease commitment fears. |
| **Trust Issues** | Build trust in the relationship through consistent, reliable behaviour from the partner. Address past traumas and work on rebuilding trust in oneself and others. Communicate openly with the partner about trust issues, seeking reassurance when needed. Let positive experiences with the partner slowly rebuild trust. |
| **Insecurity** | Experience unconditional love and acceptance from the partner. Engage in self-improvement activities to boost self-esteem and confidence. Share insecurities with the partner, seeking reassurance. Address deep-rooted insecurities alone and work on unravelling them. |

## How to Write the Ending

Your characters had other goals than just their relationship. Once the relationship is back on track (or not), you still need to tie up these loose ends.

You could also give a preview of how their relationship is going. What's next for the couple? Are they buying a flat together? Did they start seeing a couple's counsellor?

There are no wrong answers to these questions. Whatever you choose to write still needs to reflect the previous themes of the story.

**Did Character 1 achieve their non-romantic goals?**

___

**Did Character 2 achieve their non-romantic goals?**

___

**What's next for the relationship?**

___

**Did either character have to sacrifice anything? What?**

___

**How will things be different for your characters now?**

___

**Do your characters still have any regrets?**

___

## Tying Up the Loose Ends

Take stock of all the loose ends in your story. This can include unresolved side character arcs, lingering subplots, unexplained conflicts, and unanswered questions. Make a list to ensure nothing is overlooked.

Prioritise those that have a direct impact on the main characters' development or contribute significantly to the overall narrative or themes.

### Side Characters

| Side Character | How They End Up |
|----------------|-----------------|
| | |
| | |
| | |

### Subplots

| Subplot | How It Resolves |
|---------|-----------------|
