## How Do I Write Engaging Settings?

Immersive settings help a reader feel like they're really part of the story and its world. This can be especially crucial when you're trying to immerse readers in a world you made up.

When you're writing settings, think of what **tone** you're trying to convey. Make sure the details you highlight (and the figurative language you use) supports this.

For example, if you want to highlight how spooky a library is, focus on the smell of dust and the way your character's footsteps echo through it. If you want to describe the same library in a cheerful, cosy way, focus on the warm candlelight or the rustle of pages.

## How Do I Use This Cheat Sheet?

The main trick to writing engaging settings is to **engage the senses**. And not just sight! The easiest way to do this is by brainstorming using a senses table.

Writing "the city was messy and hectic, with lots of people" is nowhere near as compelling as describing the jostling bodies, the overpowering smells of sweat and perfume, and the roaring metro.

Below are seven examples that you can draw inspiration from, followed by blank templates to create your own settings cheat sheets for the settings in your novel.

## Bookshop

- **Sights:** Shelves lined with weathered books, antique wooden bookcases, leather-bound tomes with gold lettering, dust floating in the sunlight filtering through small windows, soft lamp glow
- **Smells:** The earthy scent of old pages and leather bindings, a hint of mustiness that's oddly comforting, subtle smell of ink and aged paper
- **Sounds:** The soft creak of wooden floors underfoot, rustling of pages as someone turns a book, the distant hum of city life outside, the soft chime of a bell when the door opens
- **Touch:** The embrace of an armchair as you sink into it, the crispness of paper as you turn a page, the weight of a book in your hands
- **Tastes:** Sips of freshly brewed coffee or tea from a nearby cafe, the occasional taste of dust

## Forest

- **Sights:** Towering trees, bark covered in moss and lichen, dappled sunlight filtering through the canopy, meandering paths, fallen leaves, wildflowers peeking through the underbrush
