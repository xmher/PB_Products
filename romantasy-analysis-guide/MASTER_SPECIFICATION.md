# Romantasy Analysis Guide: Master Specification

## Product Overview

**Product Name:** Read Like a Writer: The Romantasy Analysis Companion

**Purpose:** This guide helps aspiring romantasy writers learn from the books they love. It provides a framework for tracking story structure, analysing craft, and extracting lessons you can apply to your own work.

**Core Philosophy:** When you love a book, you know something works. But knowing it works isn't the same as understanding how it works. This guide helps you see the architecture behind the story—so you can build your own.

## Guide Architecture

### Three-Phase Reading Approach

The guide follows how you naturally read a book. There are things to do before you start, things to track while you're reading, and analysis to complete after you finish.

| Phase | When | Duration | Purpose |
|-------|------|----------|---------|
| **Pre-Read Setup** | Before starting the book | 5-10 min | Set expectations, note assumptions, prepare tracking |
| **Active Reading** | During reading | Per chapter/scene | Log beats, track tension, note craft moves |
| **Post-Read Synthesis** | After finishing | 30-60 min | Reverse outline, pattern recognition, lesson extraction |

## Section Specifications

### SECTION 1: How to Use This Guide (Introduction)

**Purpose:** This section explains how the guide works and sets expectations.

**Contents:**

The introduction covers the difference between reading for pleasure and reading for craft. When you read for pleasure, you let the story wash over you. When you read for craft, you notice the choices the author made.

This section also explains the colour-coding system (for marking up physical books), and the two analysis paths: quick-fill for light analysis, and deep-dive for serious study.

**Color-Coding Key:**
| Color | Meaning | What to Mark |
|-------|---------|--------------|
| Pink/Red | Romance Beats | Romantic tension, kisses, declarations |
| Blue | Fantasy/Plot Beats | Quest progress, magic use, external conflict |
| Green | World-Building | Lore, setting details, rules |
| Yellow | Character Backstory | Wounds, ghosts, motivations |
| Purple | Craft Moves to Steal | Exceptional technique worth emulating |

---

### SECTION 2: Pre-Read Setup

**Purpose:** Before you start reading, record what you expect from the book. This baseline helps you notice later when the author surprises you or delivers exactly what you anticipated.

**Timing:** Complete once before starting the book. It should take about 5-10 minutes.

#### 2.1 Book Metadata
| Field | What to Record |
|-------|----------------|
| Title | Full title |
| Author | Author name |
| Series | Series name & book number |
| Published | Publication year |
| Page Count | Total pages |
| Stated Subgenre | How it's marketed (Fae Romance, Dark Romantasy, etc.) |
| Heat Level | Expected spice level (0-5) |
| Stated Tropes | Tropes listed in blurb/marketing |

#### 2.2 Expectation Setting

Understanding your assumptions before you read helps you notice when the author surprises you. It also helps you see when they deliver exactly what the genre promises. Both are worth studying.

**Prompts:**
- What do I expect from this book based on cover/blurb?
- What tropes am I anticipating?
- What's my current mood going into this read?
- Have I read this author before? What do I expect from their style?

#### 2.3 Learning Goals
**Prompts:**
- What specific craft element am I hoping to learn from this book?
- What's a weakness in my own writing I hope this book can teach me to fix?

---

### SECTION 3: Chapter-by-Chapter Active Reading Log

**Purpose:** These logs capture your observations while they're fresh. The goal is to stay aware of craft without interrupting your enjoyment of the story.

**Timing:** Fill one out after each chapter. Aim for 2-3 minutes maximum. Don't overthink it.

#### 3.1 Chapter Quick Log Template

For EACH chapter, record:

| Field | Quick Entry |
|-------|-------------|
| **Chapter #** | Number |
| **Pages** | Start-End page numbers |
| **POV Character** | Whose head are we in? |
| **Time Elapsed (Story)** | Hours/days since last chapter |
| **Location** | Where does this take place? |

**One-Line Summary:** What is the single most important thing that happens?

**Beat Identification (Check all that apply):**
- [ ] Fantasy Plot Advancement
- [ ] Romance Beat
- [ ] World-Building/Lore Dump
- [ ] Character Backstory Revealed
- [ ] Action/Battle Sequence
- [ ] Quiet Character Moment

### SECTION 4: Romance Arc Tracking (Romancing the Beat)

**Purpose:** This section helps you track the specific beats of the romantic relationship using Gwen Hayes's framework.

**Timing:** Fill in beats as you encounter them. Some chapters may have none.

Romance readers have expectations for how a love story should unfold, even if they can't articulate them. Learning to identify these beats helps you understand why some romances feel satisfying and others feel rushed or unearned.

#### 4.1 The Romance Beat Sheet

**PHASE 1: THE SETUP (0-25%)**

| Beat | When Found | Page # | How It's Executed | Notes |
|------|------------|--------|-------------------|-------|
| **Introducing H1** | | | | |

### SECTION 5: Fantasy Plot Tracking (Save the Cat!/Three-Act)

**Purpose:** This section tracks the external plot structure that runs parallel to the romance.

**Timing:** Fill in beats as you encounter them.

In romantasy, the fantasy plot isn't just backdrop. It creates the pressure that forces romantic development. When you understand how both structures work together, you can build stories where the arcs reinforce each other instead of competing for attention.

#### 5.1 The Fantasy Beat Sheet

**ACT 1: THE SETUP (0-25%)**

| Beat | Page # | What Happens | How It Connects to Romance |
|------|--------|--------------|---------------------------|
| **Opening Image** | | | |
| **Theme Stated** | | | |
| **Setup/Status Quo** | | | |
| **Catalyst/Inciting Incident** | | | |
| **Debate** | | | |
| **Break Into Two** | | | |

**ACT 2A: FUN & GAMES (25-50%)**

| Beat | Page # | What Happens | How It Connects to Romance |
|------|--------|--------------|---------------------------|
| **B Story Introduction** | | | |
| **Fun and Games** | | | |
| **Midpoint (Victory/Defeat)** | | | |

| Beat | Page # | What Happens | How It Connects to Romance |
|------|--------|--------------|---------------------------|
| **Break Into Three** | | | |
| **Finale/Climax** | | | |
| **Final Image** | | | |

### SECTION 6: Dual-Arc Integration Analysis

**Purpose:** This section helps you see how the romance and fantasy arcs weave together.

**Timing:** You can fill this in during reading or save it for post-read synthesis.

The best romantasy novels advance both the quest and the relationship in nearly every chapter. When you visualise both arcs side by side, you can see whether the author achieves this integration—or whether the arcs run parallel without connecting.

#### 6.1 Two-Column Timeline

| Chapter | Fantasy Arc Progress | Romance Arc Progress | Integration Quality |
|---------|---------------------|---------------------|---------------------|
| 1 | | | [ ] Integrated [ ] Separate |
| 2 | | | [ ] Integrated [ ] Separate |
| 3 | | | [ ] Integrated [ ] Separate |
| ... | | | |

#### 6.2 Integration Analysis Prompts

After completing the timeline:

- At what percentage does the romance begin to drive the fantasy plot (rather than being separate)?
- Identify 3 scenes where the fantasy threat directly caused romantic development:
- Identify any "saggy" spots where one arc stalled while the other progressed:
- What external conflict forced the most emotional vulnerability?

---

### SECTION 7: Trope Execution Tracker

**Purpose:** This section documents how specific tropes are set up and paid off.

**Timing:** Add entries when you identify a trope and again when it pays off.

Tropes are promises to readers. When you advertise "enemies to lovers," readers expect certain beats. Understanding how successful authors set up and deliver on these promises teaches you to satisfy reader expectations—or subvert them in ways that feel fresh rather than frustrating.

#### 7.1 Macro Trope Analysis

**Macro Tropes** are the big relationship dynamics that define the romance.

| Trope | Setup Scene(s) | Payoff Scene(s) | Execution Notes |
|-------|---------------|-----------------|-----------------|
| **Enemies to Lovers** | | | |
| *Phase 1: Justified Hatred* | | | |
| *Phase 2: Crack in Armor* | | | |
| *Phase 3: Reluctant Allies* | | | |
| *Phase 4: Respect to Attraction* | | | |
| **Forced Proximity** | | | |
| *What forces them together?* | | | |
| *How long are they trapped?* | | | |
| *What breaks the proximity?* | | | |
| **Fated Mates/Soulmate Bond** | | | |
| *When is it revealed?* | | | |
| *How do they resist/accept?* | | | |
| **Grumpy/Sunshine** | | | |
| *First "sunshine" moment* | | | |
| *Grumpy's first smile* | | | |
| **Morally Grey Hero** | | | |
| *Worst action taken* | | | |
| *Redemptive action* | | | |
| *Reader sympathy technique* | | | |
| **Forbidden Love** | | | |
| *What makes it forbidden?* | | | |
| *Stakes of discovery* | | | |
| **Slow Burn** | | | |
| *Total pages to first kiss* | | | |
| *Number of "almost" moments* | | | |
| **Found Family** | | | |
| *When does group form?* | | | |
| *Key bonding moment* | | | |

#### 7.2 Micro Trope (Viral Moment) Tracker

**Micro Tropes** are the specific scenes that readers screenshot and share.

| Micro Trope | Chapter/Page | Setup | Execution | Quote/Moment |
|-------------|-------------|-------|-----------|--------------|
| "Who Did This To You?" | | | | |
| Hand on Throat/Necklace | | | | |
| Injury Care/Tending | | | | |
| Forehead Touch | | | | |
| Only One Bed | | | | |
| Carrying to Bed | | | | |
| Jealousy Scene | | | | |
| Training Scene Tension | | | | |
| Dance Scene | | | | |
| Rain Scene | | | | |
| First Touch (Non-Sexual) | | | | |
| "I'd burn the world for you" | | | | |
| Protective Snarl/Threat | | | | |

### SECTION 8: Tension & Pacing Visualization

**Purpose:** This section creates a visual map of emotional intensity throughout the book.

**Timing:** Update the tension thermometer after each chapter or reading session.

Pacing isn't about how fast things happen. It's about controlling emotional intensity—knowing when to build tension and when to release it. Visualising the rhythm helps you see patterns that would otherwise be invisible.

#### 8.1 The Tension Thermometer

For each chapter, rate and track:

```
Chapter: 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 ...

        └──┴──┴──┴──┴──┴──┴──┴──┴──┴──┴──┴──┴──┴──┴──┴──┴──┴──┴──┴──┘
```

**Tracking Legend:**
- **R** = Romantic Tension Peak
- **P** = Plot Tension Peak
- **B** = Both (Romance + Plot) Tension Peak
- Shade or color in the level for each chapter

#### 8.2 Pacing Pattern Analysis

After completing the thermometer:

**Questions:**
- Where are the peaks? Are they evenly distributed or clustered?
- How many chapters between peaks? (Ideal: 2-4)
- Is there a "saggy middle"? (Chapters 10-15 area)
- How quickly does tension rise after a release?
- Count the "almost" moments before the first kiss:

**Pattern Notes:**
- Tension building technique used most:
- Release valve technique used most:
- Pacing rhythm (fast/slow/varied):

---

### SECTION 9: Spice & Intimacy Tracking

**Purpose:** This section analyses the pacing and purpose of romantic and intimate scenes.

**Timing:** Log each intimate scene as you encounter it.

Intimacy scenes work best when they serve the story. Tracking where they appear and what purpose they serve helps you understand the difference between scenes that advance character and relationship versus scenes that pause the plot.

#### 9.1 Heat Level Progression Log

| Scene # | Chapter | Heat Level (0-5) | Type | What Changed After? |
|---------|---------|-----------------|------|---------------------|
| 1 | | | | |
| 2 | | | | |
| 3 | | | | |
| ... | | | | |

**Heat Level Scale:**
- **0 - Clean:** No physical intimacy beyond hand-holding
- **1 - Sweet:** Closed-door, sweet kisses
- **2 - Mild:** Heated kissing, some touching
- **3 - Moderate:** Fade to black with buildup
- **4 - Steamy:** On-page intimacy, some detail
- **5 - Explicit:** Detailed, explicit scenes

**Scene Types:**
- First Touch (Non-Sexual)
- Almost Kiss
- First Kiss
- Tension Scene (no touch, high awareness)
- Fade to Black
- On-Page Scene
- Morning After

#### 9.2 Intimacy Analysis Prompts

For each significant intimate scene:

- **What is the emotional context?** (Reunion, danger aftermath, comfort, celebration)
- **What does this scene reveal?** (Vulnerability, trust, desire, fear)
- **How does the relationship dynamic shift after?** (Power, closeness, commitment)
- **What "telling" details are used?** (Sensory words, somatic vocabulary)
- **Is this scene plot-integrated or plot-pausing?**

#### 9.3 Banter & Verbal Foreplay Tracking

**Purpose:** Analyze the verbal sparring that builds chemistry.

| Chapter | Quote/Exchange | What It Reveals | Technique Used |
|---------|---------------|-----------------|----------------|
| | | | |
| | | | |

**Banter Techniques to Look For:**
- Double meanings/innuendo
- Callback to earlier moments
- Power play/one-upmanship
- Vulnerability disguised as wit
- Pet names (mocking or affectionate)

---

### SECTION 10: World-Building Analysis

**Purpose:** This section tracks how the author delivers lore without info-dumping.

**Timing:** Note techniques as you encounter them.

In romantasy, world-building does more than create atmosphere. It creates the forces that bind characters together and the stakes that threaten them. Learning to deliver lore elegantly—woven into action and dialogue rather than dropped in blocks—is essential for the genre.

#### 10.1 Magic System Deconstruction

| Element | How It's Revealed | Integration with Plot | Integration with Romance |
|---------|-------------------|----------------------|-------------------------|
| **Source of Magic** | | | |
| **Cost/Limitation** | | | |
| **Rules** | | | |
| **Hierarchy/Types** | | | |
| **Mate Bonds/Magic Connections** | | | |

**Analysis Questions:**
- Is the magic system "soft" (mysterious) or "hard" (rule-based)?
- Does magic ever threaten the romance? How?
- Does magic ever enable the romance? How?
- Count info-dumps vs. action-integrated reveals:

#### 10.2 World-Building Delivery Techniques

**Technique Checklist:** Mark which techniques the author uses:

- [ ] **Conflict Reveal:** Rules explained during a fight/argument
- [ ] **Training Scene:** Exposition through lessons
- [ ] **Fish Out of Water:** Character learns as reader learns
- [ ] **Dialogue Debate:** Characters argue about world rules
- [ ] **Sensory Immersion:** Show world through taste/smell/sound
- [ ] **Memory/Flashback:** Past events reveal history
- [ ] **Document/Book Within Book:** Letters, prophecies
- [ ] **Travel Exposition:** World described during journey
- [ ] **Stakes Demonstration:** Show what happens when rules break

**Best Integration Example from This Book:**
(Copy a passage where lore is delivered elegantly)

---

### SECTION 11: Character Craft Analysis

**Purpose:** This section deconstructs how the author creates compelling, complex characters.

**Timing:** Fill in as you learn about each character.

Romance lives or dies on character. Readers need to fall in love alongside the protagonists. Understanding how an author builds interiority, reveals wounds, and differentiates voice helps you create characters readers will care about.

#### 11.1 Protagonist Deep Dive (H1)

**External Layer:**
| Element | Details | When Revealed |
|---------|---------|---------------|
| Name | | |
| Appearance (key details) | | |
| Role/Position | | |
| External Goal | | |
| Skills/Powers | | |

**Internal Layer:**
| Element | Details | When Revealed |
|---------|---------|---------------|
| The Wound/Ghost | | |
| The Lie They Believe | | |
| The Truth They Need | | |
| What They Fear Most | | |
| What They Want (Surface) | | |
| What They Need (Deep) | | |

**Arc Tracking:**
- Moment the wound is first shown:
- Moment the lie is first challenged:
- Moment of greatest vulnerability:
- Moment of transformation:

#### 11.2 Love Interest Deep Dive (H2)

*(Same structure as 11.1)*

#### 11.3 Character Voice Analysis

**How does the author differentiate the protagonists?**

| Element | H1 | H2 |
|---------|----|----|
| Speech patterns | | |
| Internal monologue style | | |
| What they notice first | | |
| How they express emotion | | |
| Recurring thoughts/phrases | | |

---

### SECTION 12: Scene Dissection Worksheets

**Purpose:** This section provides deep-dive analysis of key scenes to understand craft at the sentence level.

**Timing:** Use for 3-5 pivotal scenes during post-read synthesis.

This is where you move from "I loved this scene" to "I understand how it works." Breaking down a scene's structure, hooks, and techniques gives you concrete tools to apply in your own writing.

#### 12.1 Scene Anatomy Template

**Scene Identification:**
- Scene Name/Description:
- Chapter & Page:

### SECTION 13: Craft Moves to Steal

**Purpose:** This is your personal library of techniques to emulate.

**Timing:** Add entries whenever you encounter something that makes you think, "I want to do that."

Great writers are great readers. When you systematically capture the techniques that impress you, reading becomes a transferable skill. Over time, you'll build a collection of moves to draw from in your own work.

#### 13.1 Prose Techniques

| Technique | Example (Quote) | Page | Why It Works | How I'll Use It |
|-----------|-----------------|------|--------------|-----------------|
| Opening hook | | | | |

### SECTION 14: Post-Read Synthesis

**Purpose:** This section helps you step back and analyse the complete work after finishing.

**Timing:** Try to complete this within 24 hours of finishing the book, while everything is still fresh.

This is where your scattered observations become usable knowledge. The synthesis process helps you identify patterns you might have missed and extract concrete lessons for your own writing.

#### 14.1 The Reverse Outline

Go back through your chapter notes and create a one-line summary of each chapter:

| Ch | One-Line Summary | Primary Function |
|----|------------------|------------------|
| 1 | | [ ] Setup [ ] Romance [ ] Plot [ ] Both |

### SECTION 15: Multi-Book Pattern Recognition

**Purpose:** This section tracks patterns across multiple analysed books.

**Timing:** Update after completing each book analysis.

One book can teach you a lot, but genre mastery comes from recognising patterns across many examples. When you've analysed several romantasy novels, you'll start to see what's typical and what's exceptional. That's when the real learning happens.

### Connection Logic

1. **Pre-Read Setup (Section 2)** establishes baseline expectations that:
   - Get compared against actual experience in Post-Read Synthesis
   - Help identify subverted vs. fulfilled expectations

2. **Chapter Logs (Section 3)** provide raw data for:
   - Reverse Outline creation (Section 14.1)
   - Tension Thermometer visualization (Section 8)
   - Beat identification (Sections 4, 5)

3. **Romance Beats (Section 4) + Fantasy Beats (Section 5)** feed into:
   - Dual-Arc Integration Analysis (Section 6)
   - Understanding of hybrid structure

4. **Trope Tracking (Section 7) + Spice Tracking (Section 9)** reveal:
   - Reader expectation fulfillment patterns
   - Pacing of intimacy progression

5. **Character Analysis (Section 11)** deepens understanding for:
   - Scene Dissection (Section 12)
   - Voice and interiority analysis

6. **All sections** contribute to:
   - Craft Moves to Steal (Section 13)
   - Post-Read Lessons (Section 14.3)
   - Multi-Book Pattern Recognition (Section 15)
