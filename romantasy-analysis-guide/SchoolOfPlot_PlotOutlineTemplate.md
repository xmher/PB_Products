## What Is a Three Act Structure?

The three-act structure is a common framework used in storytelling. Each act serves a specific purpose in **advancing the plot and developing the characters.**

Some of the most celebrated novels and films in history use a 3-act structure, including bestsellers like **The Hunger Games.** It's a framework that you should edit to suit you. Stray from it wherever you want!

Use the table either as a guide to brainstorm your story's structure, or as a way to outline all your major story beats. If you're a bit stuck, check out the **Plot Outline Workbook** where I take you step-by-step through each major story beat.

## How to Fill the 3 Act Structure Grid

**Hook:** The opening designed to captivate the audience's attention and establish the story's tone and setting.

**Inciting Incident:** An event that disrupts the status quo & initiates the central conflict, propelling the protagonist into action.

**First Plot Point:** A pivotal moment at the end of Act 1 where the protagonist commits to the central conflict, launching the main journey. E.g. they agree to a quest.

**Rising Action:** The series of events that develops the central conflict, introduces obstacles, and heightens tension leading toward the climax.

**Midpoint:** A significant event or revelation occurring in the middle of the story, often altering the narrative's direction or deepening complexity.

**Second Plot Point:** Another major turning point at the end of Act 2 that propels the story toward the climax by introducing a significant obstacle or revelation.

**Pre-climax:** The events leading up to the climax, where tension reaches its peak, setting the stage for the climax.

**Climax:** The story's turning point where the protagonist faces the main conflict head-on, determining the resolution and outcome.

**Denouement:** The aftermath of the climax, providing closure to the story, resolving subplots, and showing the characters in their new state or changed reality.
