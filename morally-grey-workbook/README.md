# Morally Grey Love Interest Workbook

A psychological architecture workbook for romantasy and dark romance writers who want to craft morally complex love interests that are consistent, compelling, and unforgettable.

## What This Is

This is a **craft workbook**, not a prompt list. It provides structural frameworks, psychological profiling tools, and consistency-tracking systems to help you build morally grey characters who maintain their edge from first page to last -- without softening into secret cinnamon rolls or hardening into irredeemable villains.

## Sections

| # | Section | What It Covers |
|---|---------|----------------|
| 1 | **The Moral Compass Scale** | Define your character's personal code, their line in the sand, and where they fall on the heroic-to-villainous spectrum |
| 2 | **Backstory Reverse Engineering** | Link current "bad" traits to specific past survival moments using the Wound-to-Weapon pipeline |
| 3 | **The Logic of Corruption** | Build internally consistent justifications for morally wrong choices using the character's own broken worldview |
| 4 | **The Heroic / Grey / Villainous Sliding Scale** | Plot where your character sits across key story beats -- and where they shift |
| 5 | **The "Exception" Blueprint** | Design the specific dynamic where the character is dangerous to the world but soft for the protagonist |
| 6 | **Accountability & Consequence Tracker** | Ensure real social, emotional, and narrative costs for the character's choices |
| 7 | **Relationship Chemistry Architecture** | Map how moral ambiguity creates romantic tension, attraction, and conflict |
| 8 | **The Retcon Prevention System** | Consistency tools to maintain darkness through the full romance arc |
| App | **Appendices** | Archetype quick reference, morally grey trope glossary, revision checklist |
